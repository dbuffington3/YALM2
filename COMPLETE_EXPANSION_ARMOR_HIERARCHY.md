## Key Patterns Across Expansions

### 1. **Number of Tiers Evolution**
- **Underfoot-ROF**: 4 tiers (heavy progression)
- **COTF**: 2 tiers (simplified)
- **TDS-TBM**: 3 tiers (balanced)
- **EOK**: 2 tiers (simplified again)
- **RoS+**: 2 tiers + tradeskill (specialized path)

### 2. **Progression Mechanics**
- **Underfoot**: NOT progressive (separate tiers)
- **HoT-ROF**: Progressive (requires previous armor or agent)
- **COTF-RoS**: Progressive with agents
- **TBM-EOK**: Simple non-progressive right-click
- **TBL+**: Complex systems with tradeskill variations

### 3. **Creation Methods**
- **Underfoot-HoT-VOA-ROF-COTF-TDS**: Containers (Clay, Shroud, Reliquary, Box of Fear, Ethereal Attuner, Synthesis Chamber)
- **TBM-EOK**: Right-click (no containers)
- **RoS+**: Facets + containers OR tradeskill crafting

### 4. **Tradeskill Integration**
- **Underfoot**: Yes (templates required, crafting skill needed)
- **HoT-TBM**: No
- **EOK**: No
- **RoS+**: Yes (separate tier path, better stats)

## Critical Numbers for Distribution Logic

### Group Armor Pieces Per Tier
- **Standard**: 7 pieces (head, chest, legs, feet, hands, arms, wrist)
- **Classes with double wrist**: BST, NK, Shaman, Necro (have 2nd wrist alternate)
- **Template consideration**: EOK has 8 slots (7 + ranged for 2nd wrist)

### Raid Armor Pieces Per Tier
- **Same as group**: 7 pieces standard

### Tier Gap Values (Estimated)
- **2.8x between tiers**: Rough HP/mana progression (e.g., Underfoot T6→T9)
- **1.1-1.2x between tiers**: More typical progression (modern expansions)
- **Tradeskill premium**: +15-20% stat increase over group tier

---

## For YALM2 Distribution Logic

### Recommended Tier Field Structure

```lua
armor_sets = {
  [expansion] = {
    [tier] = {
      name = "Tier Name",
      type = "group" | "raid" | "tradeskill",
      progression_level = numeric_value,  -- For sorting
      components = { /* drop names */ },
      class_prefix = "Armor Set Name",
      -- Stats for comparison logic
      hp_range = { min, max },
      mana_range = { min, max },
    }
  }
}
```

### Progression Level Values

Use this numeric hierarchy for all tiers:

```
Underfoot:           1-4    (oldest)
HoT:                 5-8
VOA:                 9-12
ROF:                13-16
COTF:               17-18
TDS:                19-21
TBM:                22-24
EOK:                25-26
RoS:                27-28 (group), 29 (TS)
TBL:                30-31 (group), 32 (TS)
ToV:                33-34 (group), 35 (TS)
CoV:                36-37 (group), 38 (TS)
ToL:                39-40 (group), 41 (TS)
NoS:                42-43 (group), 44 (TS)
LS:                 45-46 (group), 47 (TS)
TOB:                48-49 (group), 50 (TS)
SRo:                51-52 (group), 53 (TS - latest)
```

This allows simple numeric comparisons: `if player_armor_level < loot_armor_level then UPGRADE`

**Key Pattern**: Each expansion adds 1-3 progression levels depending on TS tiers.

---

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Identify all unique armor prefixes** across all expansions
2. **Map item IDs** to expansion/tier (database query)
3. **Create lookup table** for fast progression determination
4. **Implement comparison logic** using progression_level values
5. **Add "tier skip" detection** to prevent giving T1 to someone with T3

- **Allakhazam Guides**: All 17 expansion guides fetched (Underfoot through Shattering of Ro)
- **Database Queries**: Use to verify item mappings to tiers
- **Item Properties**: Cross-reference questitem, cost, tradeskills flags
