## Implementation Notes

### Key Challenges

1. **Naming Consistency:** Some expansions use clear names (Boreal, Distorted), others use descriptive phrases (Faded X, Y variants). Need fuzzy matching.

2. **Piece Variants:** armor_sets.lua contains both parent sets AND piece variants (e.g., "Castaway Arms", "Castaway Chest"). Phase 1 will add tier field to PARENT sets, pieces inherit it.

3. **Tradeskill Variants:** Many sets have tradeskill versions with different names (e.g., Conflagrant vs Scaled). These are SEPARATE sets in armor_sets.lua, each needs its own tier value.

4. **Special Cases:**
   - Underfoot: Clay components (not main armor sets)
   - The Broken Mirror: Right-click only (no containers)
   - Ring of Scale: Facet-based (not container-based)
   - Recent expansions: All follow identical pattern (2 group + 1 raid + TS variants)

### Phase 1 Strategy

1. **Start with clear sets:** HoT, VOA, ROF, TDS, EOK (good naming)
2. **Add expandable framework:** Rest of code will handle unknowns gracefully
3. **Leave notes:** Add comments for ambiguous sets for Phase 2
